Model from BÃ©thermin et al. (2012, astro-ph:1208.6512, ApJL 757 23).
Extracted from Magdis+2012 with a finer grid in redshift.
http://irfu.cea.fr/Sap/Phocea/Page/index.php?id=537.  The original
SEDs are redshifted, in Jy, and normalized at LIR = 1 Lsun. The
redshift effect is thus included in the computation and lambda_grids
is thus observer frame.

The SED in ascii are assumed to be at 10 pc, and are converted in erg/s/cm/A
