Starburst models, May 2006

Spatially integrated SEDs are computed for starbursts at a distance of
50 Mpc. Free model parameter are the radius, total luminosity, visual
extinction (measured from center to surface) and as secondary
parameter the luminosity ratio of hots spots to total.

Models are sorted in directories named by the applied radius of the
nucleus. Subdirectories therein give the ratio of the OB luminosity
with respect to the total luminosity. One may also find subdirectories
called HL which are computed for high luminosity objects. Each file in
the subdirectories contain a particular SED model.  The files have two
columns and are plain ASCII. The first column is the wavelengths in
microns, the second column is the flux in Jy (at distance of 50Mpc).

Directories for 9kpc and 15kpc are attempted to include models for
high redshift objects. Here only OB stars are treated and distributed
out to the edge of the galaxy. 40% of them are embedded in
circumstellar dust (hot spots) and there is no old stellar population.


Notation:
---------

Main directories are: 
./0.35kpc
./1kpc 
./3kpc
./9kpc
./15kpc
Subdirectory names are:
./HL
./OB40
./OB60
./OB90


File naming convention:
<L><Av>_<nhs>.plot
where:
 L   is the logarithm of total luminosity in solar units: log10(L/Lsun)
 Av  is the total visual extinction measured from the surface to the center
 nhs is the dust density within the hot spots [1/cm^3]

Example:
./0.35kpc/OB90/L1170Av35.9_2.5d3.plot

This file denotes a model with a galactic radius R=0.35kpc, a ratio of
OB luminosity to total luminosity of 90%, a total luminosity of
10^(11.7) Lsun (~1.93e+45 erg/s), a visual extinction of Av=35.9mag
and a hot spot density of n(hs) = 2500/cm^3.

Usage:
------

You may start with some guess of the bolometric IR luminosity of your
starburst galaxy. Select your choice of particular parameters. For
example, in the file above: log(L/Lsun)=11.7, radius=350pc, OB90,
Av35.9 and n(hs)=2500. Read both columns of this file and scale the
flux, f(model) of column 2, to the distance D[Mpc] of your object
following:

     f = f(model)*(50/D)^2

For red shifted objects scale using luminosity distance and red
shift the wavelengths (first column) as described for example in
